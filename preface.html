	Electronic entomology is a study of miniature psychology to access dynamic movement of the world. It is an ongoing research and evolutionary archival project that looks close to the nuances of behaviours and characteristics of electronic insects. They are satellite senses that help you imagine an invisible energy flow of the world. Project was inspired by building an solar sounder circuit I came across by ralf schreiber in 2013. Mesmerized by the variation in the voice and behavior that can be created, I started to study the circuits and iterate on the designs. This is an platform to expand my thoughts, and experience the thinking through these beings.

It is a bird-watching and it is a lure making. They are an electronic cohabitant of our living space. They sing and wiggle to the sun. We dwell together. Adjusting the rhythm of my breathing to the chirps. Being woken up by clicks. Sentimental singing to the sunset.Small photodiode or solar cells are the energy harvesting organ. They have a heart that keeps their time. Shaping a wave of flow of electrons in their body. The topology of organs renders their personalities.

Through development of different organs, construction techniques, and body materials, classifications of these being are witnessed. Evolutionary process is not prompted by survival but new ways of seeing the world.
