This specie is based on a solar engine developed by <a href="http://solarbotics.net/library/circuits/se_t1_fled.html">Wilf Rigter</a>. FLED is referring to Flashing LED that is the important component in this solar engine. There is a large capacitor (1000uf to 4000uf or more) that charges to store electrons. When LED gets enough voltage to light up (2.4V~3V) it triggers transistors, then current is supplied to the motor until the capacitors go empty. It is one of the simpler electron metabolism system.
