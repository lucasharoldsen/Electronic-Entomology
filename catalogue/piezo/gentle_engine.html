<p>gentle engine is a iteration of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/catalogue/piezo/bluewhale/"> bluewhale</a> circuit. With an addition of another oscillator mixing, it created granular but rhythmical sound. They resemble an idling engine when it gets a gentle light. With full sun, the voice becomes rhythmical and higher pitched cry.
