Full sail makes the sound of a crashing wave. Flexible solar cell resembles the sail of the sailboat. It cries with a shaggy textrual expanding sound that resembles the chaotic but yet consistent sound of a wave in the ocean. </p>

There are three oscillators feeing into each other and connected in a circle. Forth oscillator is a voice that gets affected by those mixes. One of the connections between the oscillator is connected with bluewhale mixing, which is a mixing technique from <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/catalogue/piezo/bluewhale/"> bluewhale</a> that seems to produce granular texture.
