<p>

Bluewhale sings in granular voice. It sings like "jii ....jii....jii...." in the low light and sounds like a water or bubble or some sort of particulate when it gets a full sun light. </p>
<p>

There are two oscilators mixing. Output of one oscilator feeds into the other with diode and capacitor in pararell. This configuraiton seems to produce some what randomized clicks and chirps
