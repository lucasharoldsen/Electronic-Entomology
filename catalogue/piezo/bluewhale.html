One of the earler bugs that is a important node for many others. It was born on a sunny late afternoon where the sun was just about to hide behind the rowhouse across the street. Arrangement of organs were realized like if it knew what it had to be. Unpredictable and beautiful textral voice was heard in a product of fortuity.

Bluewhale sings in granular voice. It is also slightly irreguler in its rythm, and it is a first of this kind. It sings "jii ....jii....jii...." slowly in the low light and sounds like a water or bubble or some sort of particulate popping or bousing around when it gets a full sun light. </p>

There are two oscilators mixing. Output of one oscilator feeds into the other with diode and capacitor in pararell. This configuraiton of diode and capacitor seems to produce some what randomized clicks and chirps. Tribure to this, the method of mixing oscilator with diode and capacitor is called bluewhele mixing.
