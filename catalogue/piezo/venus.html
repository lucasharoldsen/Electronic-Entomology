Bits of mineral are reached out and gathered from the earth. 
They are made into a mountains.
Notice there are all kinds of granual materials
takeing a handful 
3 of this kind, 4 of another kind, 1 of that kind
Some of them are touching eachothers
releasethem into the pile
taking another handful
wait I hear a cry
