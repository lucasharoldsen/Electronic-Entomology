Orchid_0 tweets in intervals. It waits around slowly clicking and tweets. Lower the light it gets longer it waits to tweet and longer it sings per intervals. Calls are different from time to time. Using uncut components and soldering them on a hoops makes curly hoops like an orchid pedals.</p>
<p>
There are two components to this circuit. One is a pulse generator and the other is for the voice.
