Orchid_obi tweets in intervals. It waits around slowly clicking and tweets. Lower the light it gets longer it waits to sweet and longer it sings per intervals. Calls are different from time to time. Using uncut components and soldering them on a hoops makes curly hoops like an orchid pedals.</p>
<p>
Orchid_obi is a tribute to baby obi and his healthy, strong and playful growth. orchid_obi chirps away in a mix of many different birds around the house. Waiting for someday noticed by baby obi.
