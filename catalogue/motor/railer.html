This parasitic bugs colaborate with architecture and gives a material voice to them.<br><br>
railer has a spring loaded mechanicl organ that creates snap action once in a several minutes. This organ is based off of music box geared motor. Very slow rotation of motor turns the cam slowly. The cam presses the rokker arm that is spring loaded slowly increasing in distance that it presses the rokker down. When the cam gots to the endge of the curve and resets, rokker arm snappes back and hits the railing.
